    "transcript": "The geometric probability distribution is often used to model distributions of lengths of waiting times. For example, suppose that a commercial aircraft engine is serviced periodically so that its various parts are replaced at different points in time and hence are of varying ages. Then the probability of engine malfunction, p, during any randomly observed one-hour interval of operation might be the same as for any other one-hour interval. The length of time prior to engine malfunction is the number of one-hour intervals, Y, until the first malfunction."
